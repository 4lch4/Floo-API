# Floo-API

This API aims to solve the problem of interacting with multiple "endpoints" across the internet. Things such as Discord Webhooks, E-Mail notifications, SMS, Slack messages, Teams messages, etc., can be difficult to manage when you have a lot of them.

This API is a part of [Project Floo][1] and helps solve the problem by providing a simple API accompanied by an [OpenAPI Spec File][0] that enables developers to generate a wrapper library to interact with the API in their language of choice.
